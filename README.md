# TMDB-Migration-Lab 
 Code for migrating TMDB database to AWS
Abstract—This project illustrates the move to cloud computing for improved data management and analysis by showing the conversion of The Movie Database (TMDB) to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Python is used for data manipulation and integration, and 45,000 movies' worth of metadata—including user ratings—are cleaned and transferred to AWS. Scalability, accessibility, and the use of a cloud- native approach are highlighted as ways that cloud computing might be used in the film business for database administration and analytics.
